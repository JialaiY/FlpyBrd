## Project Objective
This game is meant to connect people with a user-friendly game that goes on forever. The goal of this project is to create a game that has fun and cool graphics that replicates a version of Flappy Bird with the ability to allow the user to insert a certain input to make the "bird" of the game flap to get through as many obsetacles as possible.

## Download Instructions
Download Instructions:
1. Download the file
2. Unzip it
3. Download python (if you're on Mac, it will be downloaded already)
4. Open "Command Prompt" (for Winodws) or "Terminal" (if you're on Mac)
5. In "Command Prompt" (if you're on Windows) or "Terminal" (if you're on Mac), type in 'pip3 install pygame' and hit enter
6. In "Command Prompt" or "Terminal", navigate your way to the file through the 'cd' command (moving into the folder) and the 'ls' command (looking at what's in the folder)
 
a) e.g. 'cd Downloads' would take you to what's in your downloads, and then 'ls' would allow you to see what's in the area to navigate further

b) make sure to hit enter once you have typed in the commands

Note: Make sure the name of the unzipped folder has no spaces, or else the 'cd' command won't work for it Downloading a code editor (like VS Code) might make it easier to test/run and edit the code
