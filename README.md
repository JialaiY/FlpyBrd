## Project Objective
This game is meant to connect people with a user-friendly game that goes on forever. The goal of this project is to create a game that has fun and cool graphics that replicates a version of Flappy Bird with the ability to allow the user to insert a certain input to make the "bird" of the game flap to get through as many obsetacles as possible.
